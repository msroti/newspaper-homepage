        <h3>News: Solange Saves R&B in 2016 </h3>
      <p>Published: October 27, 2016</p>
        <blockquote>
          Solange's gorgeous A Seat at the Table has created a certified moment since its release last Friday. Over the last week, the album and its accompanying videos for "Cranes in the Sky" and "Don't Touch My Hair" have been lauded for their meticulous, purposeful construction, with press outlets tracking down the contributors behind each of its moving parts to talk about their role in the process. She has undoubtedly innovated the industry.

        <h3>Art: Solange Relsease Visual Album</h3>
        <p>Published: October 27, 2016</p>
        <blockquote>
          "So we asked, “What are these iconic images in our culture?” And it’s Sean John velour tracksuits, do-rags and fur and finger waves. I don’t know if people know how hard it is to find Akademiks velour tracksuits in 2016. I had to buy some off a website from China and reach out to the brand and find some off Amazon.
          And then the blue pleated outfits, which were Solange’s reference to church choirs.Their robes are very regal. But this is kind of the unexpected fashion twist to this."
